# Build Console

This project is a web application built using the **Next.js** framework. It integrates several modern frontend libraries such as **Material UI** (MUI) for styling and components, **Redux Toolkit** for state management, and **TailwindCSS** for utility-first CSS. The project is set up for development with tools such as **Cypress** for end-to-end testing and **Faker.js** for generating fake data.
